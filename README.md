# odin-recipes

The project is a recipe book with links. Each link moves the user to a unique recipe page.
Each recipe page contains a recipe image, its description, the ingredients that are used, 
as well as step-by-step instructions. The total recipe count is 3.

Self-reflection:
  - should have committed more often
  
  - should have chosen what recipe to use beforehand, because it would have lead to cleaner
  commits, e.g
  1) choosing the recipes
  2) creating html files for these recipes
  3) committing with the message "Add HTMLs for recipes"
  4) adding images for these recipes
  5) committing with the message "Add images for recipes"
