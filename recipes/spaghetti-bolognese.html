    <ol class="steps-list">
      <li>Preheat the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4.</li>
      <li>
        Peel and finely chop the garlic and onions, pick and finely chop the rosemary, 
        then finely slice the bacon.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a splash of oil in a casserole pan on a medium heat, add the bacon, rosemary, 
        garlic and onion and cook for 5 minutes, or until softened, stirring occasionally.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the minced beef, breaking it apart with the back of a spoon, then cook for 2 
        to 3 minutes, or until starting to brown, then pour in the wine. Leave to bubble 
        and cook away.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, drain and tip the sun-dried tomatoes into a food processor, blitz to a 
        paste, then add to the pan with the tomatoes. Stir well, break the plum tomatoes 
        apart a little.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover with a lid then place in the oven for 1 hour, removing the lid and giving 
        it a stir after 30 minutes - if it looks a little dry at this stage, add a 
        splash of water to help it along.
      </li>
      <li>
        About 10 minutes before the time is up, cook the spaghetti in boiling salted 
        water according to the packet instructions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the spaghetti is cooked, drain, reserving a mugful of cooking water, then 
        return to the pan with a few spoons of Bolognese, a good grating of Parmesan 
        and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Toss to coat the spaghetti, loosening with a splash of cooking water, if needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Divide the spaghetti between plates or bowls, add a good spoonful of Bolognese to 
        each, then serve with a fine grating of Parmesan.
      </li>
