    <ol class="steps-list">
      <li>
        To prepare the wings, carefully cut through the larger joint of each wing to 
        create two pieces. Now, there will be one piece with 1 bone running through 
        like a small drumstick. Carefully cut the skin around the top of the bone 
        then scrape and push the skin and meat down, gathering at the bottom - this 
        will leave you with the top half of the bone exposed and the meat at the end 
        in a lollipop shape.
      </li>
      <li>
        Keep the wing tip end whole and repeat with the remaining wings. Preheat the 
        oven to 220°C/425°F/gas 7.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large non-stick ovenproof frying pan, toss the wings in the paprika, 
        cayenne, garlic and baking powder, then roast in the oven for 20 to 25 minutes, 
        or until golden, crisp and cooked through.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, if making the blue cheese dip, blitz the blue cheese with the yoghurt 
        until smooth. Trim and finely slice the spring onions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the wings from the oven and turn it off. Move the wings to the side of the 
        pan and add the butter. Once melted, whisk in the remaining buffalo sauce 
        ingredients and toss gently to coat. Return the wings to the warm oven for 5 
        minutes so that the glaze sticks to the wings but does not burn.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve with the blue cheese dip and sliced spring onions sprinkled over the top.
